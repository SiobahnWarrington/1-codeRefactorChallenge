# 1-codeRefactorChallenge
Repository for Week 1 Code Refactor Challenge

How I understand the challenge in my own words this week.
This week we had the challenge of refactoring the code. A standard way of calling the section a header, instead of calling the div class a header. Then because it is an actual header, the CSS no longer requires the . in front of the code to refer to it.
